# LangGraph Project

## Introduction
LangGraph is a project aimed at creating a structured and efficient way to understand and interact with language models. This README outlines the plan to understand LangGraph through various components.

## Plan

### 1. Structured Output
Structured output is essential for organizing the responses from language models in a meaningful way. The following steps will be taken to implement structured output:
- Define a schema for the output format.
- Implement functions to convert raw model responses into the structured format.
- Validate the structured output against the schema.

### 2. Add System Prompt to Graph
Adding a system prompt to the graph helps in guiding the language model's responses. The steps include:
- Define the system prompt that will be used.
- Integrate the system prompt into the graph structure.
- Ensure the system prompt is consistently applied during interactions.

### 3. Supervisor Agent
The supervisor agent oversees the interactions and ensures the system operates within defined parameters. The steps to implement the supervisor agent are:
- Define the role and responsibilities of the supervisor agent.
- Implement the supervisor agent to monitor and control interactions.
- Integrate the supervisor agent with the existing system.

### 4. Planning Agent
The planning agent is responsible for creating and managing plans based on the structured output and system prompts. The steps include:
- Define the planning agent's objectives and tasks.
- Implement the planning agent to generate and manage plans.
- Integrate the planning agent with the supervisor agent and the overall system.

## Conclusion
By following this plan, we aim to create a robust and efficient system for understanding and interacting with language models through LangGraph. Each component plays a crucial role in achieving this goal, and their integration will ensure a cohesive and functional system.
